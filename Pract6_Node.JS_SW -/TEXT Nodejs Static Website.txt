In this practical number six, that is creating a static website with the help of node js. First, we have to go to a folder, make a new folder named practical 6 then click on the path, replace the path with cmd. The command prompt will automatically open in the command prompt. You will see the path of the folder :

> npm init  //this will initialize the prompt for that path and create a package

Then after that as the package is initialized and the package. is formed we will. be able to see the package .Json demo on the command line itself. Then press press enter and in the next line of the command prompt write:

>npm install express --save  //all the packages of express js are added.

Then, as we initialized and created the package in vs code, an index.js file is automatically being created, then after installing the express packages, a package.json file is also created. Then there is a node_module folder created in vscode. Next is in index.js folder write the following code:


const express=require('express');  //we are importing express module in this project
const app=express();  //We just call express function

app.use(express.static('public'))

app.listen(4000,()=> {
    console.log("Server is started") //here we use call back function for checking if the server is started or not
})



Later create a folder public in the practical six folder and in that folder add an index.html file. A normal boiler plate of html is okay. Ride the heading in a juvenile tag as this is a static website, then save the file.

To run this index.js file in cmd type:
>node index.js

This will state the message that the. server has started then in Chrome in the. Chrome in the search bar, right, localhost:4000
